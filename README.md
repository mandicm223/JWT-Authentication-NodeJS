# JWT-Authentication-NodeJS
NodeJS authentication system powered by logic of JSON Web Tokens.
Simple frontend connected with REST API. The focus is on the implementation of an authentication system. Here, that is done with JWT tokens. On top of that, it's really important to have custom error handling implemented into your APIs because it will be very difficult to cope if our app keeps on scaling larger. And that is what this project is all about.
